# Color-Adjustment-Test
An SFML based color testing project. It responds to user input. A very simple program.
This project REQUIRES 64-bit SFML to work.

**Note: This project is very old and has barely been updated.
The delta time function barely actually does anything, but the program itself should still work relatively well.**

Despite being based on a relatively simple concept, this project was difficult to create.

It's a simple color shading test; all you have to do is press the Left Arrow or Right Arrow keys on your keyboard to trigger the effect.

Feel free to do whatever you want with the code; it's completely open-source AND public domain (but the SFML library it requires is not!)

Please bear in mind that only the source code for this project [Color-Adjustment-Test] is Public Domain. SFML is under a different license and therefore under the legal protections of it's existing license [zlib]
